# Rastrigin Function

## Foundations

- In mathematical optimization, the Rastrigin function is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms.
- The Rastrigin function has several local minima.
- It is highly multimodal, but locations of the minima are regularly distributed. It is shown in the plot above in its two-dimensional form.
- Number of variables: n
- Definition:
- Search domain:
- Number of local minima: several
- Global minimum:
