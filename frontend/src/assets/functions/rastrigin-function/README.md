# Rastrigin Function

## Foundations

In mathematical optimization, the Rastrigin function is a non-convex function used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is a typical example of non-linear multimodal function.

Finding the minimum of this function is a fairly difficult problem due to its large search space and its large number of local minima.

On an n-dimensional domain it is defined by

It has a global minimum at x=0 where f(x)=0.
